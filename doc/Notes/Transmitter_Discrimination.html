<h1> The Problem </h1>

<p>
Cheap SDR receivers lack the baseband bandwidth necessary to discriminate 
between individual 3G / 4G transmitters. Discrimination is necessary to receive
the reference signal used for the auto correlations.
</p>

<h1> A Solution </h1>

<p>
By using a highly directional antenna pointed at the transmitter and by
bandwidth limiting the received signal it should be possible to develop the
reference signal.
